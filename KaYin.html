            <p>Karen Steamed Fish Parcel is a traditional dish where seasoned fish is wrapped in banana leaves and 
               steamed. It’s infused with herbs like lemongrass, garlic, and chili, giving it a fragrant, delicate 
               flavor. Often served with rice, this dish is known for its light yet flavorful taste and is a staple 
               in Karen festive meals.
